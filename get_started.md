# Gaia Access Control sample 

The Gaia Sandbox provides a containerized simulation environment that allows you to experiment with samples written using the Gaia Platform.

This sample models a factory that contains the following:

TODO

## Overview of the Sandbox

The Sandbox UI consists of the following elements.

### Simulator window

TODO

### Ruleset, DDL, and Output tabs

There are three tabs on the left. These are windows that show:

- Ruleset: Displays the Declarative C++ code that handles TODO. You can modify the code in this tab and rebuild the sample to see how the changes affect the way that the sample runs. Rulesets encode the "business logic" that TODO
- DDL: Displays the DDL code that describes the layout of the TODO, the state of the TODO, and events the factory produces.  In short, the DDL represents the data model for the app.
- Output: Displays details when building/running your program.

## Build and run the sample

For the best user experience, run the Sandbox in full screen mode set to Full HD or higher resolution.

The Sandbox contains a complete sample for you to examine and modify.

To build the sample, select the **Build** button located above the simulator window. The state of the button changes depending on what point in the build/run cycle that you are in.

While the sample builds, the **Output** window displays the progress of the build.

**Note**: It can take several minutes to build the sample. 

When the sample has completed building, select the **Run** button. 

TODO

Now you can start experimenting with the sample to see how it affects the running of the factory. You can modify the rules and DDL. After you rebuild the sample, run it and compare results.

For more information about Rulesets and Gaia DDL, see the [Gaia technical documentation](http://docs.gaiaplatform.io).
